# Snake

Final project for *Effective Programming in Python* graduate course conducted at Faculty of Faculty of Mathematics and Computer Science of the Jagiellonian University in Krakow, Poland.

The game is implemented using the PyGame package, the code is documented via docstrings and some basic unit tests are included. The snake is controlled via arrow keys though it'd be ridiculously ease to change that to WSAD. The game features a few extensions compared to the basic version -- apart from the apple the snake can also eat poison (although he probably shouldn't), and there are additional obstacles on the map.
